Zimbabwe have reportedly agreed to travel for a short one-day international series next month, likely to take place in Lahore and Karachi. No tourists have played in Pakistan because of security fears since the terrorist attack on Sri Lanka's team bus in Lahore in March 2009 - when six policemen and two civilians died, and several of the tourists were injured. A policeman weeps over the covered body of one of his colleagues killed when gunmen attacked the Sri Lankan cricket team in March 2009. Their team bus came under fire while travelling through the city of Lahore . Sri Lankan cricketers were rescued by the Pakistani air force from Gadaffi Stadium after the terror attack . Security officials display arms and ammunition seized after the terrorists' attack on the Sri Lanka team . 'Home' Test and ODI series' in the meantime have taken place in the United Arab Emirates, England's destination for the second time this autumn, a tour for which an exact schedule is still to be confirmed. The details of Zimbabwe's proposed trip are also not yet known. But Pakistan Cricket Board president Shaharyar Khan has stated that, after discussions with his Zimbabwean opposite number Wilson Manase, he expects the short tour to go ahead. Pakistan's Misbah-ul-Haq (left) and Wahab Riaz look set to play international cricket in their homeland again . Shaharyar said: 'He (Manase) told me they are coming and they are coming with their full team - but (just) for a week. 'They will send a security team to assess the situation, following which they will confirm the tour. So they will come in the middle of May, and our efforts will be to host matches in Lahore and Karachi.'","Zimbabwe have reportedly agreed to visit Pakistan for ODI series in May .

64ee7c9eb9f1efbb7da0ce80498434c623615b84,"As Zlatan Ibrahimovic famously believes the World Cup is 'nothing to watch' without him, he's unlikely to be quaking in his boots about facing Lionel Messi in the Nou Camp on Tuesday night. For most people, Barcelona's progress into the Champions League semi-final looks a formality given they beat Paris Saint-Germain 3-1 in the first leg in France. The only man bound to disagree is the one who modestly called his autobiography 'I am Zlatan'. Zlatan Ibrahimovic is put through his paces with Blaise Matuidi (left) and Zoumana Camara at the Nou Camp . Ibrahimovic and his PSG team-mates, including David Luiz, pictured, face Barcelona on Tuesday night . The Sweden international was suspended for the first leg after he was dismissed against Chelsea . At 33, Ibrahimovic is past caring what other people think of him. With an ego that makes Louis van Gaal look like a shrinking violet, he'll walk down the tunnel at the Nou Camp convinced in his own mind that Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez will be in awe of him. When asked to name a dream team of team-mates he'd played with, he named himself up front with Messi – ahead of Thierry Henry and Alessandro del Piero. 'Football isn't something you plan in advance. It just happens,' he says. His 30-yard propellor kick for Sweden against England is rated by Steven Gerrard as the greatest goal he's ever seen. To be fair, Ibrahimovic's CV allows him plenty of bragging rights. The Swede with Bosnian roots has played for Ajax, Juventus, Barcelona and both Milan giants. He once won eight league titles in a row. Not bad for a poor kid whose immigrant parents moved to the roughest part of Malmo. Now he's trying to make new history with PSG. He was the marquee signing when Qatari owners bought the Paris side and decided to try and turn it into Europe's greatest football club. They agreed to pay him £200,000-a-week, even though France's 75 per cent top tax rate meant their total bill would be close to £50million a year. Not that Ibrahimovic is that overly grateful. He recently called France a 's**t country' and had to apologise in a rare burst of self-awareness. Despite domestic dominance, Champions League glory has remained elusive so far. Ibrahimovic has never won the trophy as a player, and his bad luck in the competition continued when he was harshly sent off in the previous round against Chelsea and was therefore suspended for the first leg against Barca. Ibrahimovic is PSG's main attraction and will take centre stage against his old club Barcelona on Tuesday . The former Barcelona striker jumps for joy after scoirng against Bastia in the French League Cup final . Ibrahimovic, pictured celebrating with Marquinhos, will be convinced that PSG can progress against Barca . For Paris to pull off one of European football's greatest comebacks, Zlatan and Marco Verratti will have to excel. Ibrahimovic undoubtedly has the talent to produce a flash of brilliance or two to put Luis Enrique's men under pressure. His balletic left-footed back heel while on the rise for Sweden against Italy at Euro 2004 was a goal very few players could have scored. His famous strike against England silenced those who wondered why he could never produce against British clubs. Against Barcelona, Ibra will have special motivation. He spent a season at the Nou Camp in 2009/10. It should have been the perfect stage for his talents but he moved to Inter Milan after just a year. Ibrahimovic spent just one season at the Nou Camp before moving to Serie A giants Inter Milan . He felt Messi's insistence on playing more centrally inhibited his own game and that coach Pep Guardiola wasn't strong enough to devise a system that could incorporate both of them. He called Guardiola a 'spineless coward' after Barcelona were beaten by Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan in the Champions League. Ibrahimovic made his point by scoring for Paris in Barcelona in a group game earlier this season. But this is the big one. Nobody will give him a chance – except for Zlatan himself.","Zlatan Ibrahimovic will line up against former club Barcelona on Tuesday .

f1800e637e0dbd90a58b2bcfa980fcbbbab1e0bb,"A lion had an unfortunate accident when it got its head stuck in a feeding barrel at a zoo in the Netherlands. Captured by a visitor to the Dierenrijk zoo, the lion can be seen inserting its head into the barrel and attempting to retrieve a piece of meat. Zoo keepers place food in barrels to stimulate the lions, as it replicates the challenges faced when the animals feed in the wild. The animal, hoping to beat two other lions to the food, reaches in too far and suddenly gets its head stuck. Reacting in a panic the lion jumps backwards and attempts to flick the barrel from its head as the other lions chase after it. Visitors to the zoo can be heard laughing hysterically while the lion desperately tries to set itself free. The animal, hoping to beat two other lions to the food, reaches into the barrel too far and gets its head stuck . The other lions chase after the barrel as the distressed animal runs around in a circle and attempts to free itself . One lion appears to come to the rescue by jumping up and standing on the barrel while the lion pulls from the ground. But unfortunately the animal is unable to free its head and the other two lions walk around looking perplexed. Feeling sorry for itself, the distressed lion stands alone in the corner before turning and running frantically towards the zoo’s visitors. The lion reacts in panic and attempts to flick the barrel from its head by running around . Visitors watch on as the lion jumps around and even runs towards the people standing at the edge of the enclosure . The video concludes with the lion looking well and truly fed up as it lies on the ground, exhausted by its failed attempts to break free. According to the video maker, the lion was eventually freed from the barrel and it was unharmed. He said: ‘To make feeding a little bit more exciting for the lions they [the keepers] put meat in a barrel with two small openings. According to the video maker, the lion was eventually freed from the barrel and it was unharmed . The other lions look perplexed and one even looks as if it is trying to help its friend by standing on the barrel . ‘The lions had to get the meat out of the barrel through the holes. Instead one lion put his head through a hole and got stuck. ‘He was walking around and bumped into some objects. He became exhausted, but is basically still all right. ‘After closing time, a veterinarian came and anaesthetised the lion. The barrel was cut off and the lion did not have any injuries. He is happily walking around again.’ The video concludes with the lion looking well and truly fed up as it lies on the ground, exhausted by its failed attempts to break free .","Zoo keepers place food in the barrels to stimulate the lions when feeding .

c42d594a9a3e079b80f921ccc215acdd5f5a5790,"A 13-year-old girl has been gunned down by ISIS snipers in the Syrian capital of Damascus as she tried to flee a militant-held area of the city, according to reports. The teenager, identified as Zeynab Daghastani, was shot and killed as she made her way through the southern streets of the Al-Yarmouk Camp towards the nearby neighbourhood of Yalda. Zeynab was shot dead on the evening of April 7 last week according to a worker at the Jafra Foundation, an aid organisation working in the area. Zeynab Daghastani, 13, was reportedly gunned down by ISIS snipers in Al-Yarmouk Camp, on the outskirts of Damascus, as she fled the militants (pictured, Islamic State fighters as they captured the camp ten days ago) According to relief workers in the area, Zeynab was killed on Tuesday as she tried to make her way from Yarmouk to a nearby neighbourhood controlled by the Syrian Army (pictured, ISIS fighters in Yarmouk) The worker, named only as Nina, also revealed that activists and relief workers were also being targeted by ISIS, according to the IBTimes. Nina told the publication that she had got the information from Aknaf Bait al-Maqdis, a Palestinian rebel group who are trying to recapture Yarmouk from ISIS. Thousands of Palestinians have been trying to escape Yarmouk since the area fell under ISIS control on April 4, leaving 200 people dead in seven days, including children who were slaughtered in front of their parents. Around 160,000 Palestinians used to live in Yarmouk, just a few miles from the palace of president Bashar Al-Assad, but many fled after his regime began bombing the neighbourhood in 2012 during the Arab Spring uprisings. The district was soon surrounded and food, water, and electricity supplies were all cut off, with around 18,000 residents still trapped inside. Around 18,000 Palestinians have been under siege in Yarmouk since 2012, before ISIS fighters moved in earlier this month. Since then thousands more have fled, while many who remained have been killed . Those who have managed to escape Yarmouk since ISIS captured it have told of militants playing football in the streets with severed heads, and children killed in front of their families . The plight of those in Yarmouk was brought to international attention in February last year when the United Nations Relief and Works Agency finally managed to bring much-needed aid to the area. Hundreds of civilians were pictured packing the bombed-out streets, desperately trying to get their hands on and food available. It was estimated that, before the UN workers arrived, the average resident of Yarmouk was living on 400 calories a day, less than a quarter of the daily recommended amount. It was reported at the time that some had taken to eating stray cats and dogs in desperation, all while being shelled and bombed by Assad's troops. Their situation became even more dire at the start of this month when ISIS stormed the camp. Around 2,500 people managed to flee before the assault took place, but many were left behind, trapped when ISIS posted snipers in the tallest buildings surrounding the southern neighbourhoods. The plight of those trapped in Yarmouk came to light in February last year when UN aid workers were allowed in after years of siege conditions, and hundreds flooded the streets in search of food . Since ISIS seized control of around 70 per cent of the Yarmouk Camp, tales of their barbarity have leaked out as other Palestinians managed to escape their clutches. Amjad Yaaqub, 16, said he found Islamic State troops playing football with the severed head of a Palestinian rebel fighter they had executed. The teenager said he stumbled upon the scene after being beaten unconscious by fanatics hunting for his brother, a resistance fighter. When he woke up he walked outside his home and found the gruesome scene taking place. Other residents have also told of the fighters' barbarity. Abdel Fatah, 55, said: 'I saw severed heads. They killed children in front of their parents. We were terrorised. 'We had heard of their cruelty from the television, but when we saw it ourselves... I can tell you, their reputation is well-deserved.'","Zeynab Daghastani, 13, reportedly gunned down as she fled Yarmouk camp .

A new plane design has revamped the areas where cabin crew can enjoy from rest and relaxation in flight, and it seems they have more space than any passengers. A slick bunk bed design has been unveiled by Zodiac Galleys Europe, giving staff a bed each and some privacy for a little shut-eye during long-haul flights. Scroll down for video . First class accommodation! Zodiac Aerospace have revealed their new designs for luxury sleeping quarters for cabin crew . The lower deck area aims to maximise the sense of space and privacy for flight attendants as they rest . Drawing on the help of 30 flight attendants from four different continents, their lower deck designs reveal an area designed to feel spacious, private and with maximum personal comfort. Every bunk is equipped with a personal service unit (PSU) offering crew with individual comfort features such as an in-flight entertainment and air conditioning system. In order to maximise the sense of space, innovative materials and lighting solutions were designed and implemented. The Zodiac Aerospace concept was revealed Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg last week, which aimed to showcase the latest developments in aircraft manufacturing. The company has been creating Lower Deck Mobile Crew Rests for Airbus A330/A340 since the '90s and is the market leader for this area. Each section boasts a personal service unit (PSU) offering crew with individual  in-flight entertainment systems and air conditioning . They aimed to start from a clean slate  in order to create a new concept for sleeping areas, and conducted extensive market research to achieve this. 'The goal was not only to improve on quantitative aspects such as cost and weight, but also to enhance the user experience,' a spokesperson for Zodiac Aerospace stated to Skift. 'In every step of the process users were involved. 'The extensive research provided a thorough understanding of the factors which influence how users experience crew rests.' Cabin envy! The deluxe areas were created after Zodiac Aerospace spoke to 30 flight attendants from four different continents . Last year other rare photographs revealed the tiny space quarters afforded to flight attendants on Boeing 373 Dreamliners. Unlike the Aerospace lower deck areas, the Boeing Crew Rest Departments (CRCs) can be located in a compartment at the top of the plane, or in a hidden section of the same cabin as passengers. Enough room to swing a cat? A file picture reveals the Crew Rest Department on board a Boeing 777 . On a Cathay Pacific 777-300ER there is a concealed staircase leading to the CRC at the rear of the plane. Attendants have to duck to get through it, but there is room for eight flight staff with six foot bunk beds with heavy curtains for blocking out noise from other crew members. Instructions state that one crew member can be on a bunk at a time, and never during taxi, take off and landing. When not in use, the secret door must be closed and latched to avoid passengers wandering in. Sleep tight: The cosy and comfortable looking crew sleeping quarters on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner .

And the tools of his unique trade include a spoon and a barbecue skewer, which he dips in dark chocolate. The service started out as a simple novelty when the owner began etching rabbits, which coincide with the cafe's theme, into cups of coffee. But the idea quickly expanded when customers started asking for more intricate and complicated designs. This means tourists to the area can leave with a special memento from their time that they can show off to family and friends alike. Captured in the short video, the cafe's owner Mr Yonzon can be seen etching the face of the much-loved Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao, into a cup of coffee.

He says: 'They've never seen anything like that. The most that they've ever seen is a leaf or a heart, and that already makes them happy, but I want to go one step further. 'I want to go one step further and give them a picture of their baby, their boyfriend, or their favourite cartoon character. If that makes them happy, that makes them smile, that's cool.' According to the Mr Yonzon, the biggest challenge he faces is to get the picture etched into the froth before it dissolves and the coffee turns cold. But he claims that his art can be done with almost any type of coffee drink and that the final product will depend on the thickness of the beverage and the amount of froth that tops it.

'You'll see the normal, simple decorations, but you won't see art in the coffee.' Mr Yonzon has now started offering small workshops at night for those who wish to learn his craft as the cafe's popularity has continued to grow. Abi Radilla, a college student who enrolled at Yonzon's workshop, said: 'My parents love to drink coffee, so maybe I can do latte art whenever they drink.' Mr Yonzon plans on expanding his special service, and hopes to soon be able to produce three dimensional caricatures.

Metal detector enthusiast Bill Ladd found the missing dog tags after a storm last year, returning them to the vet's son, William Benn of Rhode Island . Fike and Ladd gave the tags to William Benn of Providence, Rhode Island, on Sunday afternoon. Cpl. Benn manned a gun during the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. He was awarded the Silver Star for shooting down several Japanese aircraft the next year as a tail gunner on a B-17 bomber at the Battle of Midway. Benn died in 2002. Fike's group recently received a $50,000 grant. The tags came from World War II veteran Cpl. William Benn, who lost them in 1939 at a coastal artillery placement on Salisbury Beach . Purple Hearts Reunited says it will use the money from the Military Order of the Purple Heart Service Foundation to cover the 'purchase or rescue' of Purple Heart medals, the cost of framing, travel expenses and event and presentation costs. Purple Hearts are awarded to service members, or the family of service members, who have been wounded or killed in combat.

5ba8bf5e8d26e0d9e594d51a82e4a312ed37109c,"She's a professional equestrienne and was happy to have a go at wheelchair rugby, a sport nicknamed 'murder ball', during last September's Invictus Games. Now Zara Tindall, 33, has turned her hand to barrel-pulling - and laughingly pretended to pull her 16st 6ft rugby player husband Mike along while striking a pose for the cameras. The moment came during a charity event to mark the end of personal trainer Rob Edmond's marathon barrel-roll from Perthshire to Wiltshire. Taking the strain: Zara straps herself into Mr Edmond's barrel-pulling harness . Pull! Zara pretends to move off while husband Mike beams from his perch on the barrel . Edmond, who set off nine days and 517 miles ago, rolled the whisky barrel for 12 hours a day, only stopping to sleep and take part in comedy gigs at pubs along the way. The Bell's Barrel of Laughs trek also saw Edmond, who was the personal trainer on ITV's The Biggest Loser, joined by comedians including Fred MacAulay, Mark Dolan and Rufus Hound. Actress Joanna Lumley launched the challenge at the Blair Athol Distillery last week, while Zara was at the finish line at the Tedworth House Help for Heroes recovery centre. Tindall, meanwhile, joined Edmond for the final leg of the challenge - running with the personal trainer as he approached the finish line. 'It was good,' said the 36-year-old afterwards. 'I would like to say that I did all the hard work but I just got the glory run in with him. All smiles: Zara, who gave Mr Edmond a hug as he arrived (right), certainly appeared to enjoy the experience . Good effort: Mr Edmond, centre, rolled the barrel 517 miles from Perthshire to Wiltshire . Joking around: Zara, who is working towards 2016's Olympic Games, struck a series of poses in the harness . Support: Zara had turned out to watch Mr Edmond and husband Mike cross the finish line . 'I think the most impressive thing about him is that he is just a bit of a joker and he was telling stories about putting deep heat on people's hats to make their eyes water. 'He was talking about keeping his mind entertained and having a laugh. The one thing you see with people who have been around the military is that when they are in adversity or a tough place they always know how to have a laugh and how to make time pass.' Edmond, whose fundraising drive was also supported by Marston's Pubs, added: 'It's been a monumental challenge but we've made it and the support has been fantastic. 'We can't thank the British public enough.' Tindall, who recently appeared in the Bear Grylls endurance show Mission Survive, praised the work of Help for Heroes, which is set to benefit from Edmond's feat. 'Tedworth House is a pretty impressive place and looks the bees knees, and it is great to see how the money helps,' he said. He also revealed that he hopes to take on some charity challenges of his own. 'I am always quite keen to do any sort of charity challenges now that I am retired,' he said. 'I am doing a quadrathlon later this year, which I am a little bit worried about. I have always enjoyed this type of challenge, so you never know.' Achievement: Mr Edmond, who managed to cover 60 miles a day, completed the feat in just nine days . Heavy: Mr Edmond ran the entire way and rolled the whisky barrel for up to 12 hours a day . Helping out: Mike Tindall ran the final few miles alongside Mr Edmond .

a6568bfe8ea596b65eaab5fa5e13238f229e3cab,"Some teachers draw pictures on the whiteboard to explain new concepts to students. But one chemistry lecturer draws on her own skin, due to an unusual medical condition. Dr Zoe Waller, 31, who teaches pharmacy at the University of East Anglia, suffers from the skin condition dermatographia. This is a type of urticaria, or hives - where a raised, itchy rash appears on the skin at the slightest pressure. It is thought to be caused when the cells under the surface of the skin release histamines as part of an allergic reaction, causing the skin to swell. Dr Zoe Waller, 31, is a university lecturer and uses her own skin to teach her students about new drugs and molecules, as she suffers from the skin condition dermatographia . Whenever Dr Waller draws on the skin, her condition means raised red  weals appear and she can create designs. She uploads them to social media and they are making waves across the university . However instead of hiding away her condition, Dr Waller is using it as a teaching aid. Her students are required to learn 100 drugs for their course and each day, she will draw a new one on her skin. Word of the unusual teaching method has spread across the university as well as social media where Dr Waller uploads her quirky designs. She said: 'I was only diagnosed with this two years ago and it's a pretty cool condition to have. 'Some people look at my arm and think I've been self-harming but it doesn't hurt at all. 'I use a blunt pencil or cocktail stick to create the detail needed for the composition of the drugs.' Dermographism or 'skin writing' is a type of urticaria, or hives - where a raised, itchy rash appears on the skin. Dermatographia is thought to be caused when the cells under the surface of the skin release histamines under the slightest pressure. Histamines are chemicals released in the body as part of an allergic reaction, causing the skin to swell. In this type of urticaria, itchy weals occur after friction such as rubbing or stroking the skin. This itching may be aggravated by heat. Weals and red marks also often appear as lines at the sites of scratching, and generally last for less than one hour.' Antihistamines block the effect of histamine, and reduce itching and the rash in most people, but may not relieve urticaria completely. If urticaria occurs frequently, it is best to take antihistamines regularly every day. The lecturer discovered her unusual skin condition after she started working at the University's school of pharmacy. She noticed her skin was itchy and irritated but the doctor couldn't remember the name of the condition he thought she had and sent her away with anti-histamines. She said: 'I was left confused after visiting the doctor. Then my friend in America sent me a link to Ariana Russell's work and I knew then that was what I had.' Ariana Russell is an artist in the USA who uses her own body and dermatographia to create artwork. Inspired by Ariana, Dr Waller set to work on her own project - creating science molecules and compounds for her students using her skin. Her students and fellow professors often ask her for requests which she happily draws on her skin. Dr Waller said: 'My skin might not be like this forever but it's a fun and unusual way of teaching my students and it grabs their attention a lot more than a text book would.' Dr Tabi Leslie, from the British Association of Dermatologists, explained that dermographism or 'skin writing' is a type of urticaria. She said: 'Raised red weals, which are caused by the release of histamine from cells in the skin called mast cells, appear at sights of friction, such as rubbing or stroking of the skin. 'This itching may also be aggravated by heat. 'Weals and red marks often appear as lines at the sites of scratching, and generally last for less than one hour. 'Antihistamines are used to reduce the itch and the rash, and are effective in most patients. People across the university have began to make requests for designs they want Dr Waller to draw on herself . 'However, antihistamines may not relieve the symptoms completely in all cases. 'In such cases, other treatments may need to be used in addition, or higher dosages of antihistamines may be prescribed than licensed recommendations suggest. 'Sufferers of dermographism may need to take antihistamines on a daily basis, as long as the symptoms persists. Usually, the non-sedating antihistamines are preferred as they have fewer side effects. 'Treatment needs to continue until the condition settles by itself which may take years. 'Your doctor will advise you on the best regime depending on the severity of your symptoms.'

b094b897c757110ecaaf84244b4357e7c0969d14,"Zoe Hadley, also known as Zoe Hommel, who hanged herself in a hotel room after suffering a mystery illness . The teenage daughter of a leading solicitor hanged herself in a hotel room after years of suffering a mystery illness that left her unable to eat, walk or open her eyes for long periods, an inquest has heard. Zoe Hadley, 19, also known as Zoe Hommel, had been battling an undiagnosed illness since the age of 13 and was found dead at a hotel in Putney, south west London last year. An inquest at Westminster Coroners Court heard how her parents, solicitor Lisa Hommel and her GP father Laurence, struggled to treat her condition. The inquest heard how doctors could find no physical cause for her illness and that the teenager refused to accept she had mental health problems. She insisted on having a series of operations, including the removal of her healthy appendix and accused her father of conspiring to fake an operation to make her believe she'd had a surgery for a prolapse. The inquest also heard that Miss Hadley suffered from psychosis but hid the condition from doctors, making them think she was not a suicide risk. After her death, notes she had written saying she was 'tormented by voices' indicating she might have been suffering from schizophrenia, the hearing was told. A statement read to the hearing on behalf of her father, Dr Hommel, described how he and his wife fought to cope with their daughter’s illness and their vain attempts to help her. He said: 'She was a beautiful, intelligent, loving daughter. 'Up until the age of 13 she excelled at school. In 2009 she started to suffer terrible headaches and no physical causes were found. 'She was not eating, drinking or opening her eyes. It took her three months of treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital to open her eyes and look at us, four months to eat solid food, six months before she could get into a wheelchair. The cause of the illness was never found.' He said she recovered quickly and was 'so determined' to catch up with her friends after missing nine months of school she did a year’s work in just one month, later coming top of her class. However, she relapsed in April 2011 and became convinced she could not use her legs. Her parents tended to her while trying to convince her she was perfectly fit. Dr Hommel added: 'From the age of 16 she started to go to the doctors to seek diagnoses for a neurological disease she believed she suffered from and seek a cure for her paralysis. 'In September 2011 she cut off all her school friends and never spoke to them again.' During that time she was bedbound for 18 months in hospital, but decided one day she was better and started getting involved as an actress and planning to go to America to finish her studies, the inquest heard. When she was 18 she had her appendix removed without telling her parents. In May 2014, after going under anaesthetic for an 'unnecessary operation' she began to hear voices. She also suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and spent three to four hours a day washing herself and her possessions, leaving her skin raw and bleeding. At one point she was admitted to hospital after her body mass index dropped to 15, the inquest heard. The inquest heard that Miss Hadley, pictured, suffered from psychosis but hid the condition from doctors, making them think she was not a suicide risk . She was treated at the Priory clinic for OCD, but was released because she refused food and doctors feared she would starve herself to death unless she was allowed to return home and be treated there. Her father explained: 'We sought expert psychiatric help for her which she rejected. 'She became increasingly psychotic, the voices returned with intensity. She never accepted help. It was unintelligible to her that her illnesses were not physical. We hope she is finally at peace and her soul is in a better place.' Jonathan Bindman, who worked at Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health Trust, took charge of Miss Hadley’s treatment after she was released from The Priory in October 2014. He diagnosed her with somatoform disorder, an anxiety-related condition whose sufferers feel real pain that can’t be medically explained. However, he said that had she revealed the extent of her psychosis he would have diagnosed her with schizophrenia and given her the treatment she needed. He added: 'Zoe was not prepared to cooperate. Westminster Coroner's Court, pictured, heard how Miss Hadley was an intelligent and gifted young woman until showing signs of mental illness . 'She experienced delusions around the issue her father and a surgeon had faked an operation and was conspiring against her.' Detective Constable William Hanlan, who carried out the investigation into her death, said she checked into the MK Hotel in Putney on the morning of January 26 last year. The next day her body was found by a cleaner. Recording a verdict of suicide, Westminster Coroner Fiona Wilcox said: 'She was an intelligent, gifted young woman, who until the age of 13 was normal but very clever. 'From 2009 she began to show signs of a serious mental illness. Her symptoms were persistent ideas she suffered from some illness that was undiagnosed by doctors. 'She was very intelligent and used her intelligence at times to share with those around her as much as she wanted them to know and did so successfully. 'Her illness was incredibly disabling and completely affected every aspect of her life. 'She was suffering from a psychotic illness which impacted on her decision to take her own life. Maybe she intended to take her own life to escape from the illness or she took her own life suffering under a delusion. I don’t know. 'Her parents, clearly for many years, did everything possible for their daughter who was very clearly troubled and unwell.'","Zoe Hadley, 19, was found dead in a hotel in Putney, south west London .

But this political operator was less than impressed with the news, bursting into tears and complaining that the former First Lady and Secretary of State had stolen his thunder. Zeke Celello, who appears to be around two years old, was overcome with emotion when Clinton declared her second presidential bid, and insisted to his mother that 2016 is his year to shine. Devastated: Zeke Celello burst into tears when Hillary Clinton announced that she was running . More experience: Clinton, 67, pictured above declaring her intention to run, has better Washington connections than Zeke . The video, uploaded by his mother Erin to Facebook in the wake of the announcement, sees the would-be candidate repeatedly state his ambition to ascend to the nation's highest office so he could 'play... with toys'. He eventually concedes that playtime is not the top priority of a Commander-in-Chief, but is still adamant that he is up to the task. Unfortunately, Zeke appears not to have realized that the U.S. Constitution prohibits anybody from holding the presidency until they are 35. However, unperturbed, he eventually takes his mother's advice and decides to run for presidency anyway. Zeke admittedly lacks the campaigning experience of Clinton, who already has to her name a period as Secretary of State, a spell in the U.S. Senate and eight years as First Lady. But he does have the advantage of youth over 67-year-old Clinton, and, unlike his more experienced rival, will not be perceived as a political insider. Accepting Ms Celello's campaign advice, he repeats: 'I'm Zeke and I'm running for president.' While he has yet to articulate a policy platform, the youngster is clearly not short on ambition.","Zeke Celello was devastated by Clinton campaign and burst into tears .

Skiing with a friend in Revelstoke, Canada, Zach Birnie stands at the top of a mountain and films the surrounding scenery with a camera mounted to his helmet. After exhaling air, he begins to make his descent of the off-piste section of slope in a rather slow and cautious manner. Skiing off to the right, the man makes a controlled turn and begins heading back across the mountain – thick snow can be seen burying his skis. Suddenly he begins panic and while not entirely visible to the camera, a minor avalanche occurs behind him. Panicking, the man attempts to come to a stop, but the heavy snow continues to push him down the mountain. Zach Birnie stands at the top of a mountain with a friend and films the surrounding scenery with a camera mounted to his helmet . He begins shouting, which he later explains alongside the original upload of the video, was his way of making sure his friend knew what was happening. Suddenly the skier can be seen falling to the floor as heavy snow closes in around him and in a matter of moments he is completely submerged. What follows is hazy footage of a terrifying scuffle as the skier attempts to find the surface of the snow. Before too long the skier re-emerges – panting in shock as he catches his breath. The man begins skiing off to the right before making a controlled turn and heading back across the mountain . Suddenly the skier can be seen falling to the floor as heavy snow from the off-piste slope closes in around him . The skier, who was lucky to escape serious injury, later discussed the incident online. He wrote: ‘[I] pulled my shoulder slightly, lost a pole, best, worst case scenario for sure.’ Discussing the incident, Cornelia Accola from the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF spoke to MailOnline. She stated that while it is not easy to see why the avalanche occurred from the video, the amount of fresh snow and steep terrain could be to blame. In a matter of moments the skier, who shouts for his friend's assistance, is entirely trapped beneath the snow . Re-emerging not too long after disappearing, the skier pants in shock as he attempts to get his breath back . She also gave advice on what to do should you find yourself in a similar situations. 'If you are caught in such an avalanche then try to escape out of the avalanche area,' said Ms Accola. Let go of your ski poles, try to open your bindings, (rarely possible) pull your knees toward your chest and hold your arms in front of your face.'","Zach Birnie films his descent of mountain with a helmet-mounted camera .

84c8f7cbb37c1a041703cd2c0dfebefdc457a862,"A former factory girl who earned less than £100 a month is now worth £4.9 billion, and has been named China's richest woman. Zhou Qunfei has shared her incredible 'rags to riches' life story with The People's Daily, after the self-made billionaire's company Lens Technology went public – making her wealthier than Richard Branson. The 45-year-old, whose company supplies protective window glass used in Apple devices, was born into extreme poverty in a village in rural China. Zhou Qunfei, 45, has been named China's richest woman after her company Lens Technology went public . Qunfei's ID badge from when she worked in a factory, making glass for watches. She would send her salary home to her father, who was nearly blinded in an industrial accident. Her mother died when she was five. Her mother died when she was just five years old, and her father was also made blind following an industrial accident. But he encouraged her to study hard to get ahead, and she left home as a teenager to work in a glass-processing factory in Shenzhen, where she was put to work shaping glass for watches. Fed up with her monotonous job, she handed in her resignation after three months – only for her bosses to promote her to a newly-created department. Qunfei said it was perhaps their surprise that a young girl from a rural village was able to write that made them take a chance on her. Bosses at the glass manufacturer where Qunfei started her working life promoted her to head up a new department within the factory after she handed in her notice, having been impressed by the quality of her letter . Qunfei set up Lens Technology when she was just 22 years old. She invented the scratch-resistant glass made by the company after she was inspired when watching how rain would fall on the surface of lotus leaves . 'Maybe it was because my resignation letter was well written and this attracted the attention of the factory supervisor', she said. 'The kept me on and gave me a promotion to head up my own newly created department.' She rose up the ranks to become the director of the whole manufacturing operation, before deciding to set up her own company, aged 22 years old in 1993. It was her rural background that also helped inspire the invention that would help Qunfei make billions. Qunfei says when she was a child she would watch the rain falling on lotus leaves – which later inspired her to create Lens Technology's patented, scratch-resistant coating used on a range of Apple devices. 'Droplets of water would roll around the surface of a lotus leaf and not leave any trace,' she said. 'If it wasn't for my primary school teacher reminding me to be observant I may not have had the inspiration to think of my invention.' Qunfei rented a three-bedroom 'villager apartment' close to Bao'an International Airport to launch her business, using savings of £1,800 from overtime she had completed, as she sent her salary home to her father. In a bold move, she even passed on the contact details of her competitors to her customers in a bid to expand the size of the market, fearing her operation was too small for the amount of work available. Qunfei's company Lens Technology supplies Apple with its scratch-resistant glass. Shares in the company were worth 78 Yuan each on March 31, making the 590 million shares held by Qunfei worth $7.4 billion . Microsoft owner Bill Gates: £45.5 billion . Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg: £17 billion . Landlord Gerald Grosvenor: £7.7 billion (Britain's richest person) Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich: £5.4 billion . Virgin founder Richard Branson: £3 billion . Film director Steven Spielberg: £2 billion . US business tycoon Donald Trump: £2.7 billion . Designer Ralph Lauren: £4.2 billion . Now many of the world's phone manufacturers are her customers, and the number of orders taken by Lens Technology continues to rise. Her company went public on March 18 and she became the richest woman in China officially on March 30 when the market price at close for Lens Technology reached 78.07 yuan per share. This means the 590 million shares held by Qunfei as CEO had a market value of around £4.9 billion, putting her ahead of the real estate tycoon Chen Lihua who is reported to worth £4.1 billion. Qunfei says she is proud of her roots, and invited a former language teacher who urged her to study and be observant to a pre-stock market listing party for her company. Qunfei is part of an explosion of billionaires in China over the past 10 years, many of them self-made.","Zhou Qunfei born in poverty in rural China and started work on shop floor .

Zeus, a German Shepherd, was honored in a grand procession in Connecticut on Wednesday before he was put down because of a severe degenerative hip disorder and declining health. The tribute for the police dog, who worked with the Ridgefield Police Department for eight years as a K-9 officer, began around 4.45pm and ended at the Ridgefield Veterinary Hospital. Scroll down for video . Zeus (pictured above), an 11-year-old retired K-9 officer was honored in a special tribute on Wednesday by the Ridgefield Police Department . The German Shepherd, who served eight years in the force, took his last ride in a cop patrol car during the grand procession held earlier this week (Zeus pictured with Officer Shawn Murray, his former partner and carer after he retired) On Wednesday, ahead of the procession, the police department wrote an emotional message about Zeus on their Facebook. 'Today is the day we have to say goodbye to our beloved K-9 Zeus,' they wrote. 'It is an extremely emotional day for all of us. 'He was a fellow officer and friend. He will be deeply missed but never forgotten. Our thoughts and prayers are with Zeus, Officer Murray and his family during this difficult time.' During the grand procession, residents of Ridgefield lined the streets as they watched the cop cars drive by through the streets of the town. Zeus had the special tribute before he was put down because of a severe degenerative hip disorder and declining health (Zeus pictured during the procession on Wednesday) Officers from the department and police departments across the state came to pay their tributes . Zeus was being taken to Ridgefield Veterinary Clinic (above) where he was to be euthanized . The vehicles traveled from the police headquarter and ended at the veterinary hospital. Residents held signs reading 'Thank you Zeus' and 'Zeus our hero during the afternoon. A flag was waved at half staff next to a draped black cloth at the department as Officer Shawn Murray, Zeus's former partner, pushed him in a cart during the tribute. 'This is an honor to be here for him during his last moments,' Chief John Roche told WTNH.

A flag was waved at half staff next to a draped black cloth at the department (pictured above) Chief John Roche (above) said during the tribute: 'This is an honor to be here for him during his last moments' In his eight-year career with the force, Zeus assisted with more than 250 narcotics arrest and also helped officers track down 50 missing or wanted individuals. The largest amount of narcotics he was responsible for seizing was ten pounds of marijuana in 2006, when he joined the force and was partnered with Officer  Murray who he continued to reside with after his retirement. The animal had to retire last May due to health issues, and for some losing Zeus is not only losing a coworker, but also a family member. 'He was in the yard when there were picnics,' Detective Scott Murray, Officer Murray's brother told WTNH. 'He played, he chased the ball, he did what all normal dogs do, what all normal family dogs do, except he had a job.' Following the special tribute, the police department wrote their final goodbye to Zeus. On Wednesday, the police department wrote an emotional goodbye to Zeus thanking him for keeping them safe .

The 33-year-old added another two to make it a hat-trick on the night and take his total tally to 102 goals in less than three years in the French capital. To put his remarkable goalscoring record at PSG into perspective, he now trails only former Portugal forward Pedro Pauleta in the all-time record books. Pauleta scored 109 in 211 games for PSG between 2003 and 2008, Ibrahimovic has played in just 124 games so far. Zlatan Ibrahimovic slides on his knees after scoring for Paris Saint-Germain in their semi-final on Wednesday . The Paris Saint-Germain star was presented with a trophy to celebrate hitting 100 goals for the French side . Ibrahimovic’s hat-trick and a goal from Ezequiel Lavezzi saw them beat Saint Etienne 4-1 and remain on course for a unique quadruple, with a Champions League quarter-final against Barcelona to come next week. After the match, Saint-Etienne boss Christophe Galtier called Ibrahimovic the ‘best foreigner to ever play in France,’ and you would struggle to argue against that assessment. He has been a runaway success since arriving at PSG for £15.7m in July 2012 and claiming in his opening address to fans that he would become ‘part of the history of the club.’ He stuck to his pledge and was Ligue 1’s top scorer in in his first season with 30 goals, compared with the next best on 19 goals. Saint-Etienne boss Christophe Galtier called Ibrahimovic the ‘best foreigner to ever play in France' Ibrahimovic is considered to be one of the finest strikers of his generation despite his volatile demeanour . It was more of the same last season with 26 goals to his closest rival on 16. This season he has faced a challenge from Alexandre Lacazette of Lyon who is currently at the top of the French goalscoring charts but you would not bet against Ibrahimovic catching him before the end of the season. His goals for PSG have ranged from the straightforward to the important and the downright incredible – notably an audacious back heeled volley during a 4–0 win over Bastia in 2013. Ibrahimovic, pictured with Wednesday night's match ball, has never played in the Premier League . Many consider Ibrahimovic to be one of the finest strikers of his generation with an eye for the spectacular, an incredible athleticism and brilliance in the air. But a criticism often levelled at Ibrahimovic is that he has never played in the Premier League. The longest spell he has ever spent at one club is three seasons so on that basis a move away from PSG could be on the horizon. But would he choose the Premier League for a last hurrah? Here Sportsmail looks at his record his six previous clubs. Malmo 1998/99 – 2000/01 . Came through the youth ranks at the club and signed his first contract with them in 1996. Played six matches and scored one goal in his first season and Malmo were relegated. His 13 goals in 28 matches was a major factor in getting them straight back into Sweden’s top tier the next year. Around this time Arsene Wenger expressed an interest in bringing Ibrahimovic to Arsenal but he eventually moved to Ajax for a fee of £6million. Ibrahimovic came through the youth ranks at the club and signed his first contract with Malmo in 1996 . Ibrahimovic moved to Ajax in 2001 after catching the eye at his hometown club . Ajax 2001/02 – 2004/05 . There was initial frustration for the striker who did not feature prominently in manager Co Adriaanse’s plans but once Ronald Koeman took over he was given a starting berth, playing a key part as Ajax won the Eredivisie title in his first season. He scored twice in a 2-1 win over Lyon in his Champions League debut in September 2002 with Ajax eventually falling at the quarter final stage. Dutch team-mate Rafael van der Vaart accused Ibrahimovic of trying to deliberately injure him in an international game and the dispute precipitated his move away from the club. Ibrahimovic is pictured in action for Ajax in their Champions League clash against AC Milan back in 2003 . Juventus 2004/05 – 2005/06 . He reportedly expressed an interest recently in moving back to the Italian club where he feels he has unfinished business. He made an instant impact in the side which had just lost main striker David Trezeguet through injury, scoring 16 goals in his first season. The following season was a different story as he was pushed out onto the flank to play a supporting role. He seemed unmotivated at times and was criticised by fans for his apparent lack of effort in big games. Juventus were hard hit by the investigation into the Italian football scandal and relegated to Serie B at which time Ibrahimovic demanded to be released. Ibrahimovic scored 16 goals in his first season for Juventus but only lasted two years with the Serie A club . Inter 2006/07 – 2008/09 . Inter won the Serie A title each of the three seasons Ibrahimovic was at the club. It took him little time to adjust as he scored 15 goals in his first season. He scored five Champions League goals in the 2007/08 campaign and in May 2008 netted both goals in a 2–0 defeat of Parma on the final day of the season which sealed the Scudetto (Italian title) and a personal Serie A Footballer of the Year trophy. He was the league’s top scorer in 2008/09 with 25 goals, helping Inter to another Scudetto. He was also named 'Footballer of the Year' for a second consecutive season. Following his spell at Juventus, Ibrahimovic moved to Inter Milan where he won the title on three occasions . Barcelona 2009/10 - 2010/11 . Playing in possibly the best club side of all time – including Lionel Messi, Andre Iniesta, Carles Puyol and Xavi – Ibrahimovic immediately set a club record for scoring in all five of his first games. He went on to be named in the UEFA Team of the Year and was the sixth highest scorer in the league as Barcelona won La Liga. His final goal for Barcelona came in a 3–1 defeat over Sevilla which sealed a second Spanish Super Cup for Ibrahimovic. But his relationship with manager Pep Guardiola had broken down and it was time to move on. Ibrahimovic scored in his first five games for Barcelona, but left after two years in Spain to join AC Milan . Milan 2010/11 – 2011/12 . Ibrahimovic returned to Italy on loan with an option to buy for around £17.5m at the end of the season. He missed a penalty in his debut game but things soon picked up and he scored 14 league goals and won his first Scudetto with Milan, who completed their full purchase of him at the end of the season. His disciplinary record continued to be flawed and he was sent off for punching Bari defender Marco Rossi in the gut and for slapping Napoli’s Salvatore Aronica. He was Serie A’s top scorer in the 2011/12 season with 28 goals.

5a87750ed8ddb8bd64bf4caf4b6bd17f0f298e0e,"Charged: This picture shows Zachary Davis in 2012 when he was arrested aged 15 for the murder of his mother and attempted murder of his brother . A Tennessee teenager on trial for murder says he killed his mother with a sledgehammer because she knew he had been raped by his older brother and did nothing about it. Zachary Davis was fifteen when he bludgeoned his mother's skull 12 times as she slept and then set his family home ablaze in an effort to also kill his elder sibling Josh. On Tuesday, a court in Hendersonville heard how Davis, now 17, laughed as he killed his mother Melanie Davis in August 2012, leaving her bloodied and unrecognizable before fleeing. Davis is charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder and aggravated arson and the court was shown gruesome images of the crime scene as his trial began on Monday. According to prosecutors, Davis, his mother and brother went to see the comedy movie, The Campaign on August 10 and then returned home. Melanie Davis went to sleep at 9pm, 'not knowing that her younger son was planning something sinister, something unspeakable.' In testimony given to the court by Major Don Linzy, Chief of Detectives at the Sumner County Sheriff's Office, Davis confessed after he was apprehended at a convenience store eight miles away, having fled the scene. 'Yes, sir, I killed my mom in her sleep with a sledgehammer,' Linzy told the court on Tuesday according to the Tennessean. Linzy said that during his interview Davis was asked why he killed his mother with a sledgehammer and replied, 'I was worried that I'd miss,' and that using that type of weapon gave him the 'highest chance of killing her.' Battered: The teen's single mother Melanie Davis, 46, was killed with a sledgehammer while she was sleeping in her bed . Shockingly, Davis told Linzy during his confession that he he laughed out loud for no reason he could remember during his frenzied attack. He also said he only had one regret from that night, 'I would probably kill Josh with a sledgehammer too.' However, during his interrogation, Davis did tell police why he brutally killed his mother and tried to kill his brother by burning down the house. Linzy told the court on Tuesday that Davis alleged his brother, Josh raped him and that he told his mom, 'who didn't do anything about it.' Josh Davis vehemently denies ever sexually abusing his family and Linzy told the court law enforcement came to the same conclusion. 'We started a child protective team to see if it happened,' he said according to the Tennessean. 'We did not have anything to corroborate Zach's statement.' Mental illness: Zachary Davis legal team admit that their client burned his own house down and killed his mother but was suffering delusions at the time . Indeed, Josh Davis, 19, spoke in court on Tuesday and saw his brother for the first time in two years. He told the prosecution that he and Zach were close and said that until the shocking murder his entire family were all close. He said that he, Zach and his mother had bonded after the death from their father from ALS in 2007 and the first he knew of his brother's murderous intentions was on the evening of August 10. He told the court he awoke to the sound of the smoke alarm and ran to his mother's room but found it was locked. He said he broke the door down to find her dead and ran to his neighbors' home for safety. Sumner County District Attorney Ray Whitley said that on the night of August 10, Davis packed a backpack with notebooks, a toothbrush, gloves, a ski mask and a clawhammer and readied himself. Horrific: On the night of August 10 Davis allegedly attacked his mother before moving upstairs into their home's game room, pictured, where he lit a fire, hoping to kill his sleeping brother as well . Far beyond: Davis is seen here in 2012: It was determined that his charges were so severe that he would not be charged in juvenile court . 'Zach Davis had planned and intended to kill his mother and brother, and tonight was the night,' said Whitley according to the Tennessean. After killing his mother, he set fire to an upstairs room using gasoline and whiskey but closed the door and the fire did not catch as he intended. Defense attorney Randy Lucas has asked jurors to listen to all the evidence before they reached their verdict, despite admiting that his client did kill his mother. Lucas will argue that his client was suffering from mental illness. 'The voice of his father told him to kill his mother,' said Lucas to the court. A volunteer firefighter, Winton Batson, told the court how he rushed into the home to try and rescue anyone inside. He said he found his way to Melanie Davis' bedroom and saw her body. 'I saw immediately that there had been significant trauma to her skull,' he said.","Zachary Davis, 17, is on trial for the murder of his mother and attempted murder of his brother .

She also added: 'I definitely don't think it's the first time he's done this. I feel sorry for Perrie - she doesn't know this is going on. It's wrong and it has to stop.'

This photograph enraged One Direction fans as it appears that Zayn is holding Lauren's hand in the picture . That was, in fact, the only time that Zayn, who left One Direction last week after five years in the band, has made any comment on the stories of his betrayal. He took to Twitter to say: 'I'm 22 years old... I love a girl named Perrie Edwards. And there's a lot of jealous f*** in this world I'm sorry for what it looks like x' But just a week or so later Martina's claims came out. She alleged that Zayn had asked her to share a shower with him before taking her to the bedroom of the apartment where he was staying. For Cheryl, who is now re-married, the cheating rumours eventually became too much and she ended her marriage to Ashley in 2010. At the time the footballer had been accused of cheating her two years. The first was hairdresser Aimee Walton who claimed to have slept with him. By February 2010, just a month before Cheryl announced their split, four more women had come forward to say the same. Zayn and Perrie got engaged in 2013 but he has since been accused of cheating on her on several occasions . Tracey Cox says that Zayn's level of fame will be difficult for someone so young . But Perrie, who accepted Zayn's marriage proposal in August 2013,  is currently sticking by her man - who has yet to comment on the latest allegations. She and Zayn were pictured boarding a private jet earlier this week and are thought to be on a 'make or break' holiday. For the most part though, despite the on-going accusations of infidelity, Zayn has remained relatively high in public favour - unlike Ashley. We spoke to relationship expert Tracey Cox who told us that this could be because he is younger. She said: 'I think at this point the public are more lenient on him because he is a young guy in a boy band rather than a footballer, who are known for excessive behaviour and thinking the rules don't apply to them. 'But the main difference between his behaviour and that of Ashley Cole is that he's young. 'His fame might seem appealing but the reality of coping with that much money and fame at such a young age is going to have consequences. 'Of course, he's going to make some mistakes along the way. I believe him when he says he's stressed. Will Perrie and Zayn's relationship ended up like Cheryl and Ashley's? Tracey continued: 'Ashley is older and, as an adult, should have the maturity to go beyond instant gratification to be able to think through the consequences. 'The other difference of course is that Ashley was married to Cheryl while Zayn is dating. There's a different level of commitment there. 'But, even having said all that, I would join others in cautioning Perrie about trusting him again. 'The evidence appears clear that some type of infidelity is happening on a regular basis and by taking him back after each incident, Perrie is effectively saying it's OK to cheat.' MailOnline has contacted Zayn's representative for comment.","Zayn and Perrie's relationship has been dogged with cheating rumours .

Zoe O'Connell lives in a three-way lesbian relationship with her two canvassers Sarah Brown and Sylvia Knight. The 37-year-old, who used to be a man, is standing for the Lib Dems in Maldon, Essex, and is using her complex personal life at the forefront of her campaign. Three way: Candidate Zoe O'Connell (left) used to be man, Sarah Brown (centre) used to be a man married to Sylvia Knight (right). They now all live together in a three-bedroom home in Cambridge . Her two lovers, Ms Brown, 41, and Ms Knight, 39, were once a straight married couple – when Ms Brown was a man. The two are now in a civil partnership. Miss O'Connell told the Mirror: 'We're content together…that is what matters to us. I'm running for office to change things. Twenty years ago this would never have happened. 'I'm standing up because I don't think anyone should be treated differently because of gender or sexuality or the way they choose to live…we live together. We're in a relationship and we're not ashamed of that.' When the former IT worker and father of three was a man, he split from his wife in 2005. Doubts about sexuality that he had as a child re-emerged and he realised he was a woman trapped in a man's body. Miss O'Connell met transsexual Ms Brown, a former computer technician, online later that year and struck up a friendship. After marrying when she was a man, Ms Brown's sex change had forced her to divorce Ms Knight – because the law then prevented marriage between two women. But the couple were still in a relationship and living together. Ms Brown eventually told Ms Knight about Miss O'Connell – and was amazed when her partner welcomed the idea of a three-way relationship. The women have lived in a three-bedroom home in Cambridge for the past seven years. The 37-year-old, who used to be a man, is standing for the Liberal Democrats in Maldon, Essex . Miss O'Connell was a bridesmaid when Ms Knight and Ms Brown took their vows for a second time in a civil partnership six years ago. The Lib Dem candidate said: 'It just works. There's more often someone there to be supportive. If one person's off doing something else then the other partner is still there…you can just keep each other company. It's given me strength since I underwent my transition.' She says her relationship with her children – an 11-year-old boy and two girls, 13 and 14 – is 'no different' to what it would be if she was still a divorced father. She spends weekends with them, but they call her 'Zoe' instead of 'Dad'. 'The kids were three, four and five when we separated,' she said, adding: 'Over the course of about four to six months I was spending more and more time in girl mode … They kind of gradually got used to it. 'There wasn't much in the way of verbal explanation. Since then I think they've just absorbed information via osmosis … it's normal for them.' Miss O'Connell met Ms Brown on an online forum. Ms Brown said: 'It took some time before we realised we had feelings for each other. 'Zoe was married at the time and going through a divorce … and we were only friends. But we were going through the same thing, speaking to the same people and comparing experiences. We were giving each other mutual support … and we were each there when the other went through surgery.' Miss O'Connell is standing in one of the Tories' safest seats, held by John Whittingdale – vice chairman of the Conservative backbenchers' 1922 committee – who had a 19,000 majority in the 2010 election.","Zoe O'Connell, 37, is bidding to become Britain's first transgender MP .

909f44b6a41fd1faf586fb4b1d98df680fa72277,"It was the most heartbreaking tragedy of the floods that wreaked havoc around Britain last year. Little Zane Gbangbola died at home – in the middle of the night – after being poisoned by gas. For months after his death, police and other official agencies ruled out fears that the deadly fumes had come from a nearby landfill site. Instead, they insisted carbon monoxide from a faulty pump hired by his family had caused his death. But now The Mail on Sunday can reveal the damning evidence that proves the authorities have known for 14 months that hydrogen cyanide gas capable of killing Zane had leaked into the family's home as it was engulfed by floodwater. Scroll down for video . Little Zane Gbangbola (pictured) died at home – in the middle of the night – after being poisoned by gas which authorities claimed was from a faulty pump at his house . But damning new evidence proves the authorities knew for 14 months that hydrogen cyanide gas capable of killing Zane had leaked into the family's home (pictured) as it was engulfed by floodwater . The leaked official records reveal for the first time: . Last night, claims of a cover-up over Zane's death by police, the Environment Agency, Public Health England and local authorities intensified when the documents uncovered by the MoS also revealed no traces of carbon monoxide had been detected at the home in Chertsey, Surrey. The witness statements, marked restricted and confidential, were provided to police by senior fire officers the day after they attended the scene of the tragedy on February 8 last year. But Zane's grieving parents Kye and Nicole Gbangbola have faced a 'wall of silence', leading to claims of a cover-up while public agencies repeatedly insisted the boy died from carbon monoxide poisoning and that there was no risk to the wider public. Local residents accused the authorities of lying and putting lives at risk. The Gbangbolas' neighbour, Paul Marsden, 53, said last night: 'It is a disgrace that the authorities have not warned people about the dangers lurking in this land near our homes. Dr Ivan Vince, an expert in landfill gases, said last night that it was possible the cyanide gas had leached from a nearby landfill site (pictured) 'They are hoping it will go away – but it won't. It should not have taken the loss of a young life for this to come to light. Continuing to lie to people about what is there is putting other lives at risk. 'We have said all along that they found hydrogen cyanide at Kye and Nicole's house and here is the proof.' Just hours after the tragedy, despite the fact that police were in constant communication with fire chiefs, Surrey Police Chief Superintendent Dave Miller declared that landfill gases were 'not one of our lines of inquiry' into Zane's death. The force spent the next 11 months investigating carbon monoxide poisoning as the cause, before dropping its case in January on advice from the Crown Prosecution Service that there was no case to answer in relation to a hired petrol-powered pump in the family's home which they insist was never switched on. Nicole and Kye Gbangbola also needed hospital treatment because of hydrogen cyanide exposure on the night of their son's death. For months after his death, police and other official agencies ruled out fears that the deadly fumes had come from a nearby landfill site . Kye, 48, has been permanently paralysed from the waist down because of the gas, which was used to murder millions in the Nazi death camps. The couple have struggled for answers from the police, Environment Agency, Public Health England and councils ever since – and are still waiting for a coroner's inquest to be held because of the delays caused by the long-running police investigation. The Mail on Sunday has led the way in covering the tragic case – but has been stonewalled at every turn. Now this newspaper has seen leaked statements from police interviews with senior firefighters who were among the first of dozens of emergency personnel on the scene when Zane was rushed to hospital. The highly experienced officers serve with Surrey Fire and Rescue Service's Detection Identification and Monitoring team, which is called in to investigate gases. A commanding officer's statement to police says: 'As we were about to leave the premises, one of the gas detectors went into an amber alarm indicating hydrogen cyanide had been detected at levels of ten parts per million. We left immediately.' The officer says the level of gas in the house is considered dangerous if inhaled for more than 15 minutes. An immediately fatal concentration is 50 parts per million. Fire crews fled the riverside home in Chertsey, Surrey (pictured) for their own safety after their specialist gas detectors sounded the alarm for dangerous levels of hydrogen cyanide . The reading was taken at 7.29am – four hours after Zane's mother found him unconscious in a bedroom above the hallway and rang 999. After Zane was found, emergency services had opened doors and windows to ventilate the property for several hours. The firefighters double-checked their equipment and re-entered the house on two more occasions to confirm that hydrogen cyanide was in the property at 'concentrated levels', according to their incident log. It records the gas being detected at 7.47am and 8.19am. Neighbour Mr Marsden recalled seeing the firefighters 'ducking in and out of the house in breathing apparatus.' He said: 'The fire chief said to me there was hydrogen cyanide. I asked if it was ground gases and he said that was right and everyone will have to go to hospital.' Another statement seen by this newspaper says the gas detectors used by the fire service had been tested and certified as working correctly four days before Zane's death. The Gbangbolas said last night that they could not comment on the fire service documents for legal reasons ahead of Zane's inquest, due to be held later this year. A close family friend said: 'The truth is out – they have been gassed. Kye and Nicole are very angry.' Dr Ivan Vince, an expert in landfill gases, said last night that it was possible the cyanide gas had leached from the landfill site. He added: 'If this was an old unregulated tip, it could well be that cyanides were dumped many years ago. If there is acid spilt at the site, and then the water came out due to the flooding, then that would bring acid to the cyanide and release hydrogen cyanide.' This newspaper asked Surrey Police why the force had not disclosed that it knew hydrogen cyanide had been detected in the family's home hours after Zane had died. We also asked why the force spent 11 months investigating the carbon monoxide theory. A spokesman did not answer those questions but said in a statement: 'In February 2014, the post mortem examination into Zane's death proved inconclusive. 'Further thorough and extensive tests were completed. The pathologist gave a result of carbon monoxide intoxication.' The police, Environment Agency, Public Health England, Surrey Fire Service, Surrey County Council and Spelthorne Borough Council all said they could not comment in detail ahead of the coroner's inquest. A spokeswoman for Spelthorne council said: 'We are aware it is the family's belief that there is a link between the landfill close to their home and the tragic death of their son. 'However, based on current information, we do not believe there is any evidence of a causal link.'","Zane Gbangbola died at home in the middle of the night after gas poisoning .

6ddb387dd82792d3ad36cc433f5b076694c25a07,"Two chapters of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity are under investigation after they allegedly disrespected disabled veterans by spitting on them, shouting verbal abuse and urinating on the American flag during a charity weekend. Students from Zeta Beta Tau at both the University of Florida and Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, have been accused of the deplorable behavior against the ex-servicemen during the Warrior Beach Retreat in Panama City on April 17. The event is designed to give those who have sacrificed their lives for their country a relaxing break with their families at the luxurious Lakedown Wharf Resort. But instead of being acknowledged for their service, some of the attendees claim they were subjected to taunts and watched as the drunk youngsters, who were attending a formal, threw beer off the balcony. Scroll down for video . Allegations: Students from Zeta Beta Tau at both the University of Florida (pictured) and Emory University have been accused of disrespecting the ex-servicemen during the Warrior Beach Retreat in Panama City on April 17. It is not know whether anyone in this picture was involved . According to reports the police were called and the hotel security responded. They managed to get the situation under control and some of the students involved were thrown out of the hotel, but no arrests were made. Nicholas Connole, who served 18 months in Afghanistan and nine months in Iraq told WJHG the students spat at him and his service dog. 'That's just so disrespectful and it hurts,' he said. 'I come and I feel honored and I feel safe and that I belong, but now I feel like I'm defending myself.' Haley Riley, who was attending the event with her wounded husband, said beer bottles were thrown at them and students threw up in the elevators. Linda Cope, founder of the Warrior Beach Retreat, told the station she's never seen such disgusting acts. Around 60 veterans from both Iraq and Afghanistan attended with their families. She set up the event in to honor her son Joshua - an army sergeant who lost both of his legs. She described how the students were urinating off of the hotel balcony and onto an American flag. 'I have not stood up and said anything about spring break because we constantly want to get the support of the community, but if this is at all indicative of what these college students do we need to get rid of it,' she said. They also ripped a flag to shreds and were trying to run around with it in front of the wounded veterans. Zeta Beta Tau International confirmed that three members of the University of Florida chapter have been expelled from the fraternity and both university chapters have suspended all activities. However they are still investigating what has happened. The branch at the campus in Gainsville, Florida, is already under 'conduct probation' following an alleged hazing incident. A spokesman representing the nationwide fraternity said: 'Early this week our Fraternity was made aware of reports regarding an incident between several members of two of our chapters and veterans of the Warrior Beach Retreat during independent trips to Panama City Beach. 'While the details of their actions are still under investigation, there is no doubt that some of our members engaged in ugly and unacceptable behavior. Their actions have no place in ZBT or anywhere, and they will not be tolerated. Repercussions: Three members of the University of Florida chapter have been expelled. The branch was already under conduct probation following an alleged hazing incident . 'On behalf of our entire organization, I want to apologize to veterans, both those who were in Panama City Beach, and those who have felt the pain from afar, as well as to their families and all who support the Warrior Beach Retreat and had worked to make it a positive and meaningful occasion for attendees. 'I am deeply saddened that the actions of our members ruined this special event and failed to show the respect our military and their families so deserve. 'As we continue our investigation, our chapters at the University of Florida and Emory University have suspended all activities and are fully cooperating in our investigation. In addition, we have already expelled three members of the University of Florida chapter from our organization who we found to have been behaving inappropriately, and we will take any further action necessary as we learn more. 'Our Fraternity also has issued an apology on behalf of all of our members to the Warrior Beach Retreat, the organization that was hosting the veterans to provide them and their families with the opportunity to relax and recharge. 'We are honored that hundreds of our ZBT brothers have served in the military and are disgusted that certain members of our Fraternity failed to exhibit the behaviors we expect from them towards our nation's heroes — respect, gratitude and honor. 'We are committed to fully addressing the events that took place, and will be hiring an independent investigator to help us gather all of the facts. Short-term, we are actively working with the resort, with the Presidents of both universities and with the local police to fully understand the events that took place. In all instances, we have a zero tolerance policy towards this type of behavior and are committed to appropriately disciplining any members of our Fraternity who were involved. 'We also look forward to working with our members to make amends for this disgraceful situation by identifying opportunities to serve those who have done so much to serve us.' University of Florida President Kent Fuchs has personally apologized for the behavior of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity members toward the veterans. Probe: Officials at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, has deplored the actions and is investigating whether any of their students were involved. However they are yet to find any evidence tying the branch's fraternity members to the deplorable behavior in Panama City . In an email to Cope, he wrote: 'The incidents and behavior you and others have described (in letters and phone calls) and the offense to the wounded warriors and other guests are unacceptable. 'We are pursuing an investigation of the matter to learn more about the involvement of University of Florida students and whether disciplinary action will be needed.' Cope responded by saying: 'I said do your investigating, but I want to know what you're going to do. What are you going to do? I think they all should be put on probation. I'm hoping that this will make a dramatic change in their life to realize they do not need to take the sacrifice and the service of these men and women in vain.' Emory University are looking into the allegations, but could not confirm reports that any of their students were involved. A spokesman however said the behavior was not acceptable at the university. They said: 'If any members of our community are identified as being responsible, they will be held accountable for their actions by the university.' The fraternity's mission statement on its website reads: 'Mindful of its founding in 1898 as the Nation's first Jewish Fraternity, ZBT will preserve and cultivate its relationships within the Jewish community. It reads: 'Since 1954, ZBT has been committed to its policy of non-sectarian Brotherhood, and values the diversity of its membership. ZBT will recruit and initiate men of good character, regardless of religion, race or creed who are accepting of these principles.'","Zeta Beta Tau students are being investigated for the 'disgusting' acts .

After coming under scrutiny, Zoo Weekly removed all 'offending' images of a half-naked model holding a long stemmed red poppy from Facebook. The Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA) said the word 'Anzac' is protected by federal legislation since 1920 and is not authorised to be used for commercial purposes- like Zoo Weekly's 'Special Anzac Centenary Issue'- without express permission from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs.

After discovering Zoo had not sought permission, the DVA immediately notified Zoo Weekly of the breached and asked for all offending images to be removed. The issue, released on the Monday leading up to the Anzac weekend, included a 10-page feature with a list of '100 things every Aussie should know about Gallipoli'  and an interview with cover girl Erin Pash who revealed what features she admired in our service men. In the interview Ms Pas was asked what she liked about 'men in uniform', to which she replied: 'They're bad arses, they have guns and they're really fit and well built'. She then commends soldiers for 'doing what they're told' and being able to perform an 'impressive' 100 push ups, 'in a row'.

ef2ec424af2389c8b3b30128d8c35e356d3ac1ab,"Revealed: Zipporah Lisle-Mainwaring, the owner of the stripy Kensington property, may be worth up to £60million and has fallen out with her family over inheritance . The woman accused of painting red and white stripes on her £15million Kensington townhouse in a bitter planning row  is a war hero's daughter worth as much as £60million who has fallen out with her family over inheritance. Zipporah Lisle-Mainwaring has been accused by critics in her west London neighbourhood of ordering the dramatic overnight paint job ‘to get her own back’ when they objected to her plans to demolish the property and rebuild it with a two-storey ‘iceberg’ basement. Residents in the otherwise immaculate cobbled cul-de-sac in Kensington, one of the city’s wealthiest areas, said the colourful redesign was driving them ‘mad’ and likened Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring, believed to be in her early 70s, to ‘a child throwing a tantrum’. Today MailOnline can reveal Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring has also fallen out with the family of her late husband Robert, who have accused her of failing to pass on cash and property worth millions after his death in 2007. Robert Lisle, her stepson, said her behaviour does not surprise him, having last had contact with her in 2012 when they continued to row over the inheritance he believes is due to him and the wider family. He said: ‘She has made commitments and reneged on them. She’s an extremely unpleasant character'. His wife Sally claims Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring's  life revolves around money, which has left her estranged from much of her family. She said: 'She's fallen out with the family. It's sad, she is missing out on them growing up and getting married. But she's not involved because of her decisions. 'Her husband promised money and property to his children and grandchildren but after he died it never materialised. They were promises my husband's father made, but she has never kept one. 'She's so rude, in fact she is the rudest person I've ever met. 'Money is not our god - but money is her god. We don't need it to be happy, we are already, but it is for her. She's got nothing else in her life, no friends, just her and her money'. Ms Lisle-Mainwaring's original name is understood to be Patricia Royde, who later changed her name to Zipporah - the name of Moses' wife - because of 'vanity', her family claim. She is the daughter of a Second World War hero pilot, Flying Officer George Reicher Royde, who was handed the Distinguished Flying Cross in 1942 for helping fly a bomber back to Britain from a European raid when the pilot was injured, saving the rest of the crew on board. But in 1943 he was shot down over Belgium while heading to bomb German factories and buried in the Schoonselhof Cemetery. In May 2013 Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring helped unveiled a memorial at the crash site to remember her father's life and the others lost. Neighbours of a £15million townhouse in South End, Kensington - one of the most exclusive areas of London - have branded the property an ‘eyesore’ after it was painted with red and white stripes following objections to knock it down and replace it with a five-storey mansion . Memorial: In May 2013 Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring, second from right, helped unveil a memorial at the crash site to remember her father's life and the others lost when his RAF plane was shot down in 1943 . Residents surrounding her stripy Kensington townhouse told MailOnline they are ‘horrendously unhappy’ with the new exterior of the three-storey terraced home in South End, Kensington, and likened it to a ‘beachside hut’. Planning documents show Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring wanted to replace the property with a five-storey ‘traditional mews-style’ home, including a two-story basement complete with gym, media room and swimming pool with a double-height ceiling. The new property could be worth £25million. Hero: Her father Flying Officer George Reicher Royde, was handed the Distinguished Flying Cross in 1942 for helping fly a bomber back to Britain from a European raid when the pilot was injured, saving the rest of the crew on board . The plans were initially turned down by Kensington and Chelsea Council but approved on appeal. However, a neighbour then lodged a legal challenge which means the case will go to the High Court in June where a final decision will be made. Residents now believe that Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring, a property developer, ordered the garish paint job - which took place under the cover of darkness - as an act of revenge for the legal challenge. While Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring’s solicitors refused to comment yesterday on the motives behind the dramatic paint job, there is little doubt that it has rubbed the objecting neighbours up the wrong way. Saskia Moyle, 18, who lives opposite the house with her father, said the new colourful exterior had not gone down well with local residents, with the majority complaining that it lowers the classy tone of the quiet cobbled street. She told MailOnline: 'The neighbours are all horrendously unhappy with it. Everyone's complained. We all hate it. It's a bit of an eyesore. 'The woman who owns it put in a planning application to go down two floors but it was rejected and now we think she's trying to do this so the council is forced to demolish it'. Colin Burchett, a chauffeur who works from the neighbouring road, said the property had been receiving lots of attention from tourists, who now regularly visit the quaint street to take photos. He said: ‘In terms of the paint job, I just think it’s really bizarre. I’d like to know how they have got away with it. ‘Surely it’s a listed building or there must be restrictions. All of the windows on the street are exactly the same and when another property in the road wanted some work done there was a notice up for ages. I can’t see how they’ve got away with it.’ The owner of the £15million Kensington townhouse was once involved in a high-profile legal challenge over another property dispute. Zipporah Lisle-Mainwaring, along with her husband Robert - who died in 2007, four years into the marriage -, was the owner of Yeoman's Row Management Limited which became embroiled in a legal battle with property developer Mr Cobbe. The dispute began in 2002 when Mr Cobbe verbally agreed to buy and redevelop a block of 13 flats in Knightsbridge owned by Yeoman's. At his own expense, it was decided that he would apply for planning permission for the development to turn the flats into six terraced houses. Residents said they are ‘horrendously unhappy’ with the new exterior of the three-storey terraced home in South End, Kensington, which suddenly appeared after legal challenges thwarted a planning application to give the home a double basement to include a swimming pool . The house (pictured centre before the paint job which occurred in the last couple of weeks) was bought by Zipporah Lisle-Mainwaring several years ago and turned from office space into storage space. She now wants to turn it into a residential property measuring five-storeys . Ms Lisle-Mainwaring has submitted several planning applications but ultimately wishes to demolish the current property and rebuild it to take it from three-storeys to five-storeys with a double basement below ground. It will include four bedrooms, a gym, pool and media room . The company would then sell Mr Cobbe the property for £12million upon the planning application being successful, and when the work was completed, he would have to give Yeoman's 50 per cent of the profits if the sale was in excess of £24million. If the planning application was not successful, Mr Cobbe would receive no payment. The contract was purely verbal and there was no written formal agreement or the instruction of lawyers. Mr Cobbe spent about £200,000 obtaining planning permission between 2002 and 2004 and, on the day after the consent was granted, Yeoman's told him the agreement no longer stood. The firm claimed the agreement had lapsed as the consent had not been obtained within a set period of time and refused to sell him the land. Mr Cobbe started legal proceedings, claiming the company had breached the verbal contract, and the case went to the High Court. He said he should be paid for the work he carried out to obtain planning permission and also claimed a right to the land since its value had increased considerably thanks to the planning consent. The Court of Appeal ruled to award Mr Cobbe a sum in excess of £5million but the House of Lords overturned the decision, claiming Mr Cobbe was not entitled to ‘property estoppel’ because he did not have a formal contract. However, the Lords ruled that Mr Cobbe was entitled to a sum for 'unjust enrichment' and he was awarded around £200,000 to cover the cost of obtaining planning permission and a fee for his services. During the case, the Chancery Division and the Court of Appeal criticised Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring’s conduct as ‘unconscionable’ and ‘unpleasant’. Afterwards, solicitors Clarke Wilmott said the fact Mr Cobbe had only been paid for his time and expenses meant Ms Lisle-Mainwaring was ‘laughing all the way to the bank’. The Knightsbridge development, which is currently under construction, was described in objection letters by residents as something which would cause ‘irreparable damage’ to the ‘quality of life and sense of community’ on the street while ‘solely benefiting the commercial developers’. Yeoman's Row Management Limited is no longer active and it is understood Ms Lisle-Mainwaring now splits her time between the UK and Switzerland, with properties registered in London and Geneva. Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring was unavailable for comment today but her solicitor said her Kensington home was not bought for £15million and would not be worth £25million if the two years of proposed work is completed. He also denied claims by neighbours the stripes were painted during the night, backed up by the man who painted them. The tradesman, who did not want to be named, told MailOnline: 'It's not true it was painted during the night. I did it in five hours during the day around six weeks ago. I wasn't told why I had to do it, but I read in the newspapers it was to do with the neighbours'.","Zipporah Lisle-Mainwaring accused of painting £15million house like a 'beach hut' in row over planning application .

ba2cc7036dbb26f386586a1758d42b59d4bbd384,"Schoolgirl killer Zbigniew Huminski (pictured) did not offer a word of remorse as he was indicted for kidnapping, raping and murdering a nine-year-old . Calais schoolgirl killer Zbigniew Huminski did not offer a word of remorse as he was formally charged with a range of crimes which are likely to see him jailed for life, prosecutors said today. The 38-year-old appeared before a judge on Friday night and was indicted for kidnapping, raping and murdering the nine-year-old identified solely by her first name of Chloe. Despite being banned from France for earlier offences, Zbigniew was on his way to England on Wednesday from Calais when he struck. A statement released by Boulogne prosecutors said: 'The investigating judge conducted his indictment for the following reasons: rape of a minor, kidnapping and murder. 'During his interrogation, the person in custody had admitted his involvement in the alleged crimes, but failed to state the reasons for his action.' Confirming that Huminski had been 'placed in custody in a regional prison', his lawyer Antoine Deguines said: 'He did not speak to the judge, as his right. 'I have not been able to speak much with him, he does not talk much and, it seems, is in shock over what happened. It's hard for him to address the facts'. Asked if Zbigniew had offered any remorse, Mr Deguines said: 'No, he is saying very little about anything.' It came as thousands prepared to take to the streets of Calais on Saturday to take part in a second 'White March' to pay tribute to Chloe, whose funeral will take place in the port city's St Peter's Church on Wednesday. Mr Deguines confirmed Huminski had been on his way to see his sister in Southampton when he 'stopped for a beer' in Calais, and then attacked Chloe while drunk. Huminski was supposed to be in prison in Poland - but he exploited his home country's lax justice system to travel to France instead. This picture was the last taken of nine-year-old Chloe at 2.31pm - she is seated in front of her family home. Relatives have put this photograph at the scene where she was kidnapped . The career criminal was sentenced to a year behind bars in March, but under the rules in Poland, he was supposed to take himself to jail. But he hit the road for France and, under the EU's free movement rules, there was nothing to stop him driving across Europe. Nine-year-old Chloe, seen in a last haunting photo posing with a carefree grin in the playground outside her home, was snatched as her terror-stricken mother tried helplessly to reach her. Huminski has confessed to strangling his nine-year-old victim, identified by her first name of Chloe (pictured) Before Isabelle Hyart could do anything, Huminski bundled Chloe into his car and drove her to woodland where he sexually assaulted and strangled her. Huminski has a long criminal record in France and Poland, including once attacking a frail woman of 78 with a knife in her home. He was convicted in France in April 2010, when has jailed for six years for aggravated assault, before being released early in March 2014, when he was deported to Warsaw. Ms Hyart, a mother of two other young children, said: 'I'm appalled, disgusted. I don't understand why he was in France. And why did he come to Calais? I don't understand how anyone could do that to a child of nine.' Ms Hyart said the brazen abduction happened in broad daylight on Wednesday when she left her daughter in the playground to pop back inside the flat to change her four-year-old son's clothing. Huminski, who is single, originally moved to France in the early 2000s, and worked as an odd-job man before attempting to join the Foreign Legion as a soldier. He was rejected because of his long criminal record in France and Poland. Natacha Bouchart, the Calais mayor, said: 'How could a foreigner with many previous convictions be allowed to move freely around Calais? There is a clear dysfunction in the way we keep track of repeat offenders.' Last summer, Alice Gross, 14, was murdered by a Latvian builder who moved to the UK after serving a prison sentence for killing his wife. Arnis Zalkalns, 41, spent seven years in jail in Latvia but was still allowed in to Britain without having his record checked. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls called for a full investigation in to Huminski's past, saying Chloe's family deserved the 'whole truth'. Christine Taubira, the justice minister, also demanded a 'complete, precise and rapid' investigation.' The little girl's naked body was found in the woods near Calais 90 minutes after she was taken .

ede974f527ad7614d7c10eaed5900ea413c6f559,"Zoe Gregory (pictured) pleaded guilty to sending an email hoax to blow up the school where she worked . A schoolgirl was branded ‘Holly bin Laden’ by other pupils after a teaching assistant framed her for a bomb hoax, a court heard yesterday. Holly Littlefield, 16, was arrested and held in a police cell for 14 hours after Zoe Gregory, 26, hijacked her email account to issue the threat to blow up the school. She was too scared to return to school for two days and when she did she was taunted by classmates. The teenager told the court how after she was arrested she was ‘crying and distressed’ and struggled to sleep in the cell surrounded by ‘people on drugs or drunk’. Even after she was released on bail, she remained under suspicion for nearly three weeks until checks revealed Gregory was responsible. Another pupil, Vicky Francis, 15, was also arrested after police were told she had access to Holly’s email account. Gregory, a married mother-of-two who said she was suffering from depression at the time of the offence and could not face work, is now likely to receive a lengthy jail term after admitting to communicating false information. Magistrate Jeanne Heal said the case was being referred to the Crown court for sentencing, telling the defendant: ‘What makes this a worse offence than you might imagine is that two young girls were in custody for more than ten hours and were interviewed by police. ‘They were also on bail and during that time they must have been under stress. You deserve a greater punishment than we can give.’ Speaking afterwards, Holly’s mother Lesley, 43, said: ‘We are pleased she has admitted it. ‘The girls have been through a horrible time at school and hopefully now their classmates will realise the truth.’ Vicky added: ‘I feel sorry for her children because they didn’t know what was going on but I think she should go to jail.’ Pupils Vicky Francis (pictured left) and Holly Littlefield (right) outside Norwich Magistrates' Court. The pair were arrested and held by police following the bomb threat sent from Miss Littlefield's account . Bomb threat: Ormiston Victory Academy in Costessey near Norwich (pictured) where the scare took place . The girls’ ordeal began on February 9, when police officers arrived at Ormiston Victory Academy in Costessey, near Norwich, to arrest them. Both were fingerprinted, had DNA samples taken and had to pose for mugshots before they interviewed. They denied any knowledge of the bomb scare and were released on police bail early the following day. Holly’s home was also searched and police seized the family’s computer and three iPhones. Prosecutor Lisa Britton told Norwich magistrates: ‘Holly was asked lots of questions about the email. She said in a statement she didn’t know what was going on.’ Vicky had also been left ‘scared and crying’ by the experience and suffered taunts at school, she added. Officers had acted after Gregory told the vice principal she had found an email in her inbox which warned: ‘There will be a bomb in school on Monday.’ Gregory (pictured second from left) arriving at Norwich Magistrates' Court. Chris Brown, mitigating, said she had been suffering from post-natal depression and acted out of 'sheer desperation' when she sent the email . Facing jail: Gregory has been warned she could face up to seven years in prison due to the seriousness of the offence. An Ormiston Academies Trust spokesman said the 29-year-old had been dismissed from her job . In fact, she had overheard Holly’s email password and used it to access the schoolgirl’s account. It was only later that police discovered the IP address of the hoax email originated from a computer at the home of Gregory’s father. Holly said outside court: ‘I was treated like a criminal. One officer asked me, “Do you regret what you have done?” and I said “I haven’t done anything"". ‘During my interview they told me that if it had been a joke I should just tell them. I even thought about admitting it just so I could leave, but I could not do that as I had not done anything. ‘It quickly got right round the school that I had been arrested. When they found out it was because of a bomb hoax, people were running up to me and saying “Have you got a bomb?” ‘I was even being called “Holly bin Laden”. It was so upsetting because I have never been in trouble with the police before.’ Holly Littlefield with her mum Lesley. Pupils dubbed Miss Littlefield 'Holly Bin Laden' following the incident . Chris Brown, defending, said his client came up with the ‘ill-conceived and unsophisticated’ hoax while suffering postnatal depression after the birth of her second child. He asked the magistrates to show her mercy and give her a suspended sentence for the ‘dreadful error of judgment’. But they decided to send the case to Norwich Crown Court where the maximum sentence she could receive is seven years. A school spokesman said: ‘The staff member involved has been dismissed and we are doing everything we can to support the students involved. We will not tolerate any action which disrupts the education of students at our school.’ Gregory declined to comment after the hearing.","Zoe Gregory, 26, hijacked pupil's email and threatened to blow up school .

b4148969d817a8d2a2ce336eec737e75c651aa27,"A Missouri family has bee reunited 49 years after a mother was falsely told her daughter had died at the hospital just hours after being born. For the first time, Zella Jackson Price, 76, and Melanie Diane Gilmore, 49, met in-person at Price's Olivette home. When Price gave birth at Homer G. Phillips Hospital so many years ago, she was told shortly after delivery that the infant had died. But Gilmore was alive and for an unknown reason adopted by another family. Scroll down for video . Zella Jackson Price (pictured), 76,  was told shortly after delivering her baby that the infant had died. But the baby was still very much alive and had for an unknown reason been given up for adoption . Melanie Diane Gilmore, 49, has been reunited with her mother after 49 years. Her children helped her find her mother through a name given to Gilmore through her adoptive parents . Price and Gilmore immediately embraced when the daughter arrived at her mother's house in Olivette, Missouri . 'I'm so elated. I'm just hugging her and there's such a big family. She didn't know she had so many people here in St. Louis,' she said. Price told Daily Mail Online that when she was still in the hospital ward, she was told by doctors her baby, which was prematurely born, had died. The details she was given were very vague, and she said she was told the baby's twin had died, too, even though she had only had a single-child birth. The hospital had a big maternity ward, she said, adding that she had seen women nursing the wrong babies while she was there. 'There's a lot of information they should have given me,' Price said. 'I still have a lot of questions.' Friends of Gilmore's foster parents revealed to Price this week that her daughter had spent six months in an incubator before being taken to the family who adopted her. Her foster parents have since died, but Price said it was heartwarming to know that she grew up in a good home. 'She ended up in a family of love. They cared for her so much,' Price said. Gilmore, who lost her hearing when she was three years old after a childhood illness, said meeting her biological mother - her father has passed away - is something she's wanted for a long time. Price and Gilmore exchanged many hugs and said they loved one another during their first in-person meeting . 'I'm just so happy... very excited,' she told KTVI. Gilmore's four children knew about their mother's wish and researched a name that Gilmore was given from her adoptive parents. They eventually came across Zella Price. Price received a text message from one of Gilmore's four children at 4am several weeks ago, something she 'will never forget'. 'She texted me a messaged asking if I was her grandmother. I said, ""Why do you think that"", and she started asking questions and asked if I had given birth on November 25 - which I had,' Price said. The mother and daughter eventually video chatted on Oovoo and the pair did a DNA test and confirmed Price was Gilmore's mother. And then they decided to meet in person. On the day she met her mother, Gilmore was also able to meet her biological brother Harvey, who picked her and her own daughter and son up at Lamber-St. Louis International Airport. The family had flown from Oregon. Gilmore also had a chance to meet her biological brother Harvey, who picked Gilmore and her children up from the airport . When the mother and daughter finally came face-to-face, they hugged for several moments and said they loved each other. 'There was a bond that automatically started when we saw each other,' Price said. She added that she has been hurt by the separation and is relieved to have a new start. '(God) has given me everything the devil has taken from me,' Price, an accomplished gospel singer, told KTVI. 'I'm getting it back. I'm getting my baby back.' Price said that Gilmore's kids told her they hadn't ever seen her as happy as she was when she arrived in St. Louis to meet her biological mother. 'She's been dancing and all of her comedy and laughter has come out,' Price said. 'We're all so happy.' The family will soon begin an investigation into what happened at the hospital the day Gilmore was born. Price has hired an attorney to help with the process. But for now, they celebrate being a family once again. 'There’s nothing greater. There’s nothing greater than this. Nothing,' Price said. Price (center) said that she's looking forward to having a second chance at forming a relationship with her daughter, who she thought had died nearly 50 years ago .","Zella Jackson Price of Olivette, Missiouri, gave birth to her baby 49 years ago .

a7893656c994f01a5ec947896a2f1cbee2cd4e5f,"A veteran has described the hurt he felt after being disrespected by a mob of University of Florida fraternity members during a charity weekend that honors wounded heroes in Panama Beach City. The Zeta Beta Tau fraternity was suspended Friday and charged with obscene behavior, public intoxication, theft, causing physical or other harm, and damage to property for allegedly disrespecting disabled veterans by spitting on them, shouting verbal abuse and even urinating on the American flag. The deplorable behavior against the ex-servicemen occurred at the Warrior Beach Retreat on April 17. 'They actually spat on me and my service dog as well, and that's just so disrespectful and it hurts,' wounded veteran Nicholas Connole, who served 18 months in Afghanistan and nine months in Iraq, told WJHG. 'I come and I feel honored and I feel safe and that I belong, but now I feel like I'm defending myself.' Scroll down for video . 'Hurt': Nicholas Connole, a wounded veteran who served 18 months in Afghanistan and nine months in Iraq, said both he and his dog were spat on by university students in Panama Beach City for a spring formal . Disrespected: The soldier, seen here with his wife, said he felt like he had to 'defend himself' against the students, who threw beers and spat from their balconies . Scene: The students were staying here at the Warrior Beach Retreat. The abuse occurred mostly when servicemen were walking past . Allegations: Students from Zeta Beta Tau at both the University of Florida (pictured) and Emory University have been accused of disrespecting the ex-servicemen during the Warrior Beach Retreat in Panama City on April 17. It is not know whether anyone in this picture was involved . Linda Cope, founder of the Warrior Beach Retreat, says she's never seen such disgusting behavior. 'They're a total disgrace for our military,' she told the network. 'They were urinating on the American flag they were throwing things off of the balconies.' The veterans were staying at the Lake Town Wharf Resort and the students were in town for their spring formal. 'I have not stood up and said anything about spring break because we constantly want to get the support of the community, but if this is at all indicative of what these college students do we need to get rid of it,' said Cope. 'Disgusting': Linda Cope, founder of the warrior group, says the frat members were urinating on flags and verbally abusive . Happier times: Nicholas Connole is seen here proposing to his now-wife in a photo from his Facebook. The returned soldier was wounded while serving, but was abused while attending a charity event . Emory University have now finally commented on the incident. In a statement a spokesman said that while they were 'appalled' at what happened, there was 'no evidence  found to implicate Emory students in these reported incidents'. 'If any members of our community are identified as being responsible, they will be held accountable for their actions by the university,' the statement continued. Hope said that the statement was a 'slap in the face to veterans'. 'There were too many students from Emory for none of them to be involved,' she said. 'It is hard for me to believe that no Emory student was a part of this.' According to reports the police were called and the hotel security responded. They managed to get the situation under control and some of the students involved were thrown out of the hotel, but no arrests were made. Haley Riley, who was attending the event with her wounded husband, said beer bottles were thrown at them and students threw up in the elevators. About 60 veterans who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan were also attending a retreat that has been held twice a year for the past six years at the resort. Cope started the event in honor of her son Joshua, who lost both legs in Baghdad in 2006 when a roadside bomb exploded under his Humvee. Zeta Beta Tau International confirmed that three members of the University of Florida chapter have been expelled from the fraternity and both university chapters have suspended all activities. However they are still investigating what has happened. The branch at the campus in Gainsville, Florida, is already under 'conduct probation' following an alleged hazing incident. A spokesman representing the nationwide fraternity said: 'Early this week our Fraternity was made aware of reports regarding an incident between several members of two of our chapters and veterans of the Warrior Beach Retreat during independent trips to Panama City Beach. 'While the details of their actions are still under investigation, there is no doubt that some of our members engaged in ugly and unacceptable behavior. Their actions have no place in ZBT or anywhere, and they will not be tolerated. Repercussions: Three members of the University of Florida chapter have been expelled. The branch was already under conduct probation following an alleged hazing incident . 'On behalf of our entire organization, I want to apologize to veterans, both those who were in Panama City Beach, and those who have felt the pain from afar, as well as to their families and all who support the Warrior Beach Retreat and had worked to make it a positive and meaningful occasion for attendees. 'I am deeply saddened that the actions of our members ruined this special event and failed to show the respect our military and their families so deserve. 'As we continue our investigation, our chapters at the University of Florida and Emory University have suspended all activities and are fully cooperating in our investigation. In addition, we have already expelled three members of the University of Florida chapter from our organization who we found to have been behaving inappropriately, and we will take any further action necessary as we learn more. 'Our Fraternity also has issued an apology on behalf of all of our members to the Warrior Beach Retreat, the organization that was hosting the veterans to provide them and their families with the opportunity to relax and recharge. 'We are honored that hundreds of our ZBT brothers have served in the military and are disgusted that certain members of our Fraternity failed to exhibit the behaviors we expect from them towards our nation's heroes — respect, gratitude and honor. 'We are committed to fully addressing the events that took place, and will be hiring an independent investigator to help us gather all of the facts. Short-term, we are actively working with the resort, with the Presidents of both universities and with the local police to fully understand the events that took place. In all instances, we have a zero tolerance policy towards this type of behavior and are committed to appropriately disciplining any members of our Fraternity who were involved. 'We also look forward to working with our members to make amends for this disgraceful situation by identifying opportunities to serve those who have done so much to serve us.' University of Florida President Kent Fuchs has personally apologized for the behavior of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity members toward the veterans. Probe: Officials at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, has deplored the actions and is investigating whether any of their students were involved. However they are yet to find any evidence tying the branch's fraternity members to the deplorable behavior in Panama City . In an email to Cope, he wrote: 'The incidents and behavior you and others have described (in letters and phone calls) and the offense to the wounded warriors and other guests are unacceptable. 'We are pursuing an investigation of the matter to learn more about the involvement of University of Florida students and whether disciplinary action will be needed.' Cope responded by saying: 'I said do your investigating, but I want to know what you're going to do. What are you going to do? I think they all should be put on probation. I'm hoping that this will make a dramatic change in their life to realize they do not need to take the sacrifice and the service of these men and women in vain.' The fraternity's mission statement on its website reads: 'Mindful of its founding in 1898 as the Nation's first Jewish Fraternity, ZBT will preserve and cultivate its relationships within the Jewish community. It reads: 'Since 1954, ZBT has been committed to its policy of non-sectarian Brotherhood, and values the diversity of its membership. ZBT will recruit and initiate men of good character, regardless of religion, race or creed who are accepting of these principles.'","Zeta Beta Tau suspended and charged for the 'disgusting' acts .
